whole webside is based on flexbox and grid view
I just create a sidebar with links to follow my portfolio.
<!-- header section -->
Image used as a logo is created by me in illustrator. And use animation effect to dispaly my name with my profile. Also, add name and images of people who inspires me to choose this line. 2 images are clicked by and first from unsaplash.com....
<!-- features -->
fontawesome.com is used to display icons.
<!-- interest -->
to show interesting background image is clicked by me and others are from unsaplash.com. 
in gallery part span and grid view is used to display images clear

I learn html css in 2020 from online courses and from youtube 
for this portfolio website I use all my learning items named css grid, flexbox.


I name all the columns to make it easy to display on different size screen
[ [sidebar-start][sidebar-end full-start][center-start] [col-start] [col-end] )  [center-end] [full-end] ]

For web 
for nav I use side bar but for TAB and MOBILE convert it back into navbar 

<!-- header -->
linear gradient is used for background image 
for h1 is animated with transform effect
But I wanted to use typing effect unfortunatly I have no idea of javascriptI learnt It but don't want to take any risk I watched BRAD TRAVERSY's tutorials.
 <!--gallery  -->
 span is very good tag to mold images according to design
